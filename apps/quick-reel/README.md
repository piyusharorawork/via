## Transitions

Video transitions are techniques used to move from one scene or shot to another in a video. Here are various types of video transitions:

1. **Cut**: The most basic transition where one shot instantly replaces another.

2. **Fade**: Gradually transitions from one shot to black (fade out) or from black to a shot (fade in).

3. **Dissolve**: Blends one shot into another, creating a smooth transition.

4. **Wipe**: One shot is replaced by another through a sliding motion, often in a specific direction (left, right, up, down).

5. **Slide**: Similar to a wipe, but the new shot slides in from one side while the old shot slides out.

6. **Zoom**: The camera zooms in or out to transition between shots, often creating a dramatic effect.

7. **Spin**: The shot rotates out while the new shot rotates in, creating a dynamic transition.

8. **Morph**: Transforms one image into another, often used for creative effects.

9. **Split**: The screen is divided into sections, with different shots appearing in each section.

10. **Ripple**: Creates a wave-like effect as one shot transitions to another.

11. **3D Flip**: The shot flips over in 3D space to reveal the next shot.

12. **Luma Fade**: Uses brightness levels to transition between shots, often creating a dramatic effect.

13. **Flash**: A quick white or colored flash that transitions between shots.

14. **Crossfade**: Similar to dissolve, but specifically refers to audio transitions where one audio track fades out while another fades in.

15. **Graphic Match**: Transitions between two shots that have similar shapes or colors, creating a visual connection.

These transitions can be used creatively to enhance storytelling and maintain viewer engagement.
